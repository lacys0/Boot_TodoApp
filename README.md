# Todo Application with Spring Boot

A web-based CRUD application for task management, built on Spring Boot. This project showcases core Spring framework capabilities, data persistence, and modern development practices including comprehensive testing and Continuous Integration.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Standard CRUD operations for todo items.
- **Subject Categorization:** Associate todo items with specific subjects (e.g., Work, Personal).
- **Due Dates:** Assign due dates to tasks, with overdue items highlighted.
- **Subject Management:** Dedicated interface for managing subjects.
- **Data Persistence:** Utilizes an in-memory H2 database via Spring Data JPA.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Java 17+ (Spring Boot 3.x)
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Web Framework:** Spring MVC, Thymeleaf
- **Database:** H2 Database
- **ORM:** Spring Data JPA
- **Utilities:** Lombok
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito, JaCoCo
- **Code Quality:** Checkstyle
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Version Control:** Git

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or higher
- Maven
- Git

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/lacys0/Boot_TodoApp.git](https://github.com/lacys0/Boot_TodoApp.git)
    cd Boot_TodoApp
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    ./mvnw.cmd clean install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    java -jar target/todoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

    _(Adjust `todoapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to match your actual JAR file name)_

    Access the application in your browser: `http://localhost:8080/`

4.  **H2 Database Console:**
    Access the in-memory database console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`. The JDBC URL will be provided in the application logs (e.g., `jdbc:h2:mem:unique-id`). Use `sa` as username, no password.

## Testing & Code Quality

### Unit Tests & Coverage

Tests are written for the service layer using JUnit 5 and Mockito. JaCoCo is configured for code coverage reporting.

- Run tests and generate reports:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw.cmd clean verify
  ```
- View JaCoCo report: `target/site/jacoco/index.html`
  _(Service layer currently achieves 100% line and method coverage.)_

### Code Style Checks

Checkstyle is integrated into the Maven build to enforce coding standards (Google Java Format). A successful build requires passing Checkstyle.

- Run Checkstyle:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw.cmd clean validate
  ```
- View Checkstyle report: `target/site/checkstyle.html`

## Continuous Integration (CI)

The project leverages [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) for CI. Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/ci-build.yml` to automatically build, test, and publish artifacts upon pushes and pull requests.

Monitor build status and download artifacts via the "Actions" tab on the GitHub repository.

## Project Requirements Summary

This project addresses the core requirements of the "Programming Environments" course:

- **CRUD Web Application:** Fully functional.
- **Spring Boot Web App:** Utilizes Spring Boot.
- **Multi-Entity Design:** Includes `TodoItem` and `Subject` entities with a relationship.
- **In-Memory Database:** H2 with Spring Data JPA.
- **CI Build:** Implemented via GitHub Actions.
- **Artifact Publishing:** Artifacts available post-CI build.
- **Unit Testing:** JUnit/Mockito for service layer.
- **Code Coverage:** JaCoCo configured, with **100% service method coverage** achieved.
- **Code Style:** Checkstyle applied, successful build required.
- **Version Control:** Continuous commits on public GitHub repo.
